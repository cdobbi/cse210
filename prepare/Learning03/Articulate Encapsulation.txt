Instructions

What is encapsulation and why is it important?
Your response must:

Explain the meaning of Encapsulation
Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation
Provide an application of Encapsulation
Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote
Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
